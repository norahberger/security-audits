# 🔐 Security Audits

This folder contains the security assessments and audit reports I've completed as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

Each audit is based on a simulated company scenario. I follow a structured approach to assess risk, identify vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to improve security posture.
